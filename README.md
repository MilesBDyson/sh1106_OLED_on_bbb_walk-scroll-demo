# sh1106_OLED_on_bbb_walk-scroll-demo
Random walk renderer for SH1106 128x64 on BBB I2C bus 1 addr 

playing around with Duck AI and made this, not really exciting, just moves the screen around keeping the dot (walker) in the center of the screen leaving a line behind. interesting little screen saver or demo maybe? but deffinitly a nice example of scrolling around a largeer image then the screen can display at on time.
